# Shredder Machine Accident Prevention by Detecting Hand 

Description : 

Designed and implemented a custom object detection model using TensorFlow, capable of identifying various objects and potential hazards near the shredder machine. Integrated the computer vision system with the shredder's control unit, enabling real-time communication and immediate response to safety threats. 
Assembled google coral toolkit for clients requirement and installed it on site for preventing shredder machine accident  Collaborated with data annotation team, business analyst and product manager to deliver idle solution.

# Hand-Detection
Hand Detection to avoid accident in shredder machine , deployment can be done in google coral / jetson nano
